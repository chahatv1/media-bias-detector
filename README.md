# Media Bias Detector ‚Äî Political News Classification

This project presents a fine-tuned **RoBERTa-based** text classification model that predicts the political bias of news headlines ‚Äî whether they lean **Left**, **Right**, or are **Neutral**.  

Using **Python** and **Streamlit**, the app provides an intuitive interface where you can input a headline and receive real-time bias predictions. Backend model weights are pulled directly from the Hugging Face repository.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: Backend scripting and inference with `transformers`, `torch`, and `streamlit`
- **Hugging Face Hub**: Hosted model weights & tokenization
- **Streamlit**: Interactive UI for real-time inference
- **Data Skills Applied**:
  - Text preprocessing & tokenization
  - Confidence scoring and model predictions
  - Model fine-tuning on political datasets
  - Web deployment and user interface design
